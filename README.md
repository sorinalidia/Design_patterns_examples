# Design_patterns_examples
In this repo you'll see some examples of design patterns ilustrated in java code. I chose to implement 3 designs of each category, but there are more.

For more information you can visit the site that I used as bibliography: https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/catalog .
You'll find there each design pattern explained in detail.
